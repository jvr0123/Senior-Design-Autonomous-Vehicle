## General info
This project is our submission for EECS 159A/B at the University of California, Irvine. 

As the project progresses more will be added here.
	
## Technologies
The frameworks we are using:
* pyQt: v5.11.3
* OpenCV: v4.5.0
* Tensorflow v2.3

In addition, a Raspberry Pi 4 B+ with 8GB of ram is functioning 
as our controller onboard the car along with a compatible camera module.
## Setup
The Pi is loaded with the python file control.py. It is then accessed remotely and controlled by a client run on a desktop that cas connected to the pi.
